Manage Properties icons (optional runtime load)
================================================
Copy these 4 sprites from Assets/Sprites/Icons into this folder so the Manage Properties panel can load them automatically:
  - build.png   (as "build")
  - Sell.png    (as "Sell")
  - Mortage.png (as "Mortage")
  - Redeem.png  (as "Redeem")

Alternatively, assign them on UIDocumentManager in the Inspector (Property Manager Icons section).
